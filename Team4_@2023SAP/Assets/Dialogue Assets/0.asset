  - Eh! Que miras? I'd quit staring so dumbly unless you want your eye taken out.
  - What? You want information on the mysterious painter? Rumor has it they live
    in this very neighborhood and buy paint using their own pocket money.
  - They do an art performance in front of everyone, even while the pigs try to find
    their identity. I work in machinery, which is dangerous, but that artist got
    more cojones than me. Personalmente, los respeto por ello.
  - You want my thoughts about their color usage? Well, not that opinion matters,
    but I would like to see red and yellow incorporated in their next piece because
    they remind me of my favorite bullfighter!
