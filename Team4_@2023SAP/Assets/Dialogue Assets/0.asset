  lines:
  - Mysterious line of dialogue, so mysterious, in fact, that you can't tell what's
    going on...
  - Disarmingly unmysterious and friends, perhaps even jovial, line of dialogue that
    really makes the player feel really nice and warm inside.
  - Now the character seems kinda bored and they're talking about colors, the plot
    in this story is completely stupid, I think it's dumb and I don't really like
    it.
