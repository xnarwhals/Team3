  - Eh! Que miras? I'd quit staring so dumbly unless you want your eye taken out.
  - What? You want information on the mysterious painter? If it will leave me alone,
    rumor has it they apparently live in this very neighborhood and buy paint from
    their own pocket money.
  - They do their art in front of everyone even while pigs are trying to figure out
    their identity. I may be risking my life while working, but that artist got some
    cojones doing something like that. Personalmente, los respeto por ello.
  - You want my thoughts about their color usage? Well, not that opinion matters,
    but I would like to see some red and yellow incorporated in their next piece
    because they remind me of my favorite bullfighter of all time!
